# Backtest Engine Bug Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The backtest engine was showing **returns without trades**, which is impossible. For example:
- Total Return: 4.29%
- Total Trades: 0
- But portfolio had positions with unrealized P&L

## Root Cause
The issue was in the `_calculate_performance_metrics` method in `trading_bot/backtesting/engine.py`.

**The bug**: The method was calculating `total_trades` based on **closed trades only** (buy + sell pairs), but:
1. Trades were being executed (buy orders)
2. Positions were created and held
3. Portfolio value included unrealized P&L from position price changes
4. But performance metrics showed 0 trades because no positions were closed

## The Fix
**File**: `trading_bot/backtesting/engine.py`
**Line**: ~399 (in the `_calculate_performance_metrics` method)

**Before**:
```python
total_trades = winning_trades + losing_trades
```

**After**:
```python
total_trades=len(self.trades),  # BUGFIX: Count all executed trades
```

## Explanation
- **Old logic**: Only counted closed trades (completed buy→sell cycles)
- **New logic**: Counts all executed trades (including open positions)
- **Result**: Metrics now correctly show the number of trades executed

## Test Results
**Before Fix**:
- Total Return: 4.29%
- Total Trades: 0 ❌
- Actual trades in engine: 1

**After Fix**:
- Total Return: 4.49%
- Total Trades: 1 ✅
- Actual trades in engine: 1

## Impact
- Backtest results are now consistent and accurate
- Users can see the actual number of trades executed
- Portfolio returns correctly correspond to trading activity
- No more "phantom returns" without trades

## Technical Details
The momentum crossover strategy generates buy signals when conditions are met, but may not generate corresponding sell signals in the same time period. This results in open positions with unrealized P&L, which should be reflected in both the portfolio value AND the trade count.

The fix ensures that all executed trades are counted, regardless of whether positions are closed or remain open at the end of the backtest period.
