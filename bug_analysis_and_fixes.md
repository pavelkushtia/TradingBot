## Bug #1: Division by Zero Vulnerability in Stochastic Oscillator Calculation

### Location
`trading_bot/indicators/core.py`, line 347

### Bug Description
The Stochastic Oscillator calculation has a division by zero vulnerability when `highest_high == lowest_low`. While there is a check `if highest_high != lowest_low:`, this only prevents the division but doesn't handle the case where the stochastic values aren't calculated, potentially leading to incomplete indicator data.

### Current Code
```python
if highest_high != lowest_low:
    k_percent = ((close - lowest_low) / (highest_high - lowest_low)) * 100
    self.k_values.append(k_percent)
    # ... rest of calculation
```

### Impact
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Risk**: Incomplete technical analysis data could lead to poor trading decisions
- **Symptoms**: Missing stochastic values in flat market conditions (no price movement)

### Root Cause
The code doesn't handle the edge case where the high and low prices are identical over the lookback period, which can occur during:
- Market holidays or low liquidity periods
- Price gaps or halted trading
- Very short timeframes with minimal price movement

### Fix Implementation
The fix involves handling the edge case by providing a neutral stochastic value when there's no price range:

```python
if highest_high != lowest_low:
    k_percent = ((close - lowest_low) / (highest_high - lowest_low)) * 100
else:
    # Handle flat price range - use neutral value (50%)
    k_percent = 50.0
    
self.k_values.append(k_percent)

# Calculate %D (SMA of %K)
if len(self.k_values) >= self.d_period:
    self.ready = True
    recent_k = list(self.k_values)[-self.d_period :]
    d_percent = sum(recent_k) / len(recent_k)

    result_dict = {"%K": k_percent, "%D": d_percent}
    return IndicatorResult(self.get_name(), result_dict)
```

## Bug #2: Race Condition in Order Execution Manager

### Location
`trading_bot/execution/manager.py`, lines 273-352

### Bug Description
There's a critical race condition in the order execution system where the `_mock_execute_order` method can access and modify order state concurrently with order cancellation operations. This can lead to orders being processed after they've been cancelled or removed from the pending orders dictionary.

### Current Code
```python
async def _mock_execute_order(self, order: Order) -> None:
    """Mock order execution for simulation."""
    try:
        # Simulate execution delay
        await asyncio.sleep(self.mock_fill_delay)

        # Check if order was cancelled
        if order.id not in self.pending_orders:
            return
        
        # ... later in _mock_fill_order
        if order.id:
            self.completed_orders[order.id] = order
            del self.pending_orders[order.id]  # Race condition here!
```

### Impact
- **Severity**: High
- **Risk**: Data corruption, incorrect order states, potential financial losses
- **Symptoms**: 
  - KeyError exceptions when trying to delete already-removed orders
  - Orders appearing in both pending and completed states
  - Inconsistent order tracking statistics

### Root Cause
The execution flow has multiple async operations that can interleave:
1. Order submission creates a task for `_mock_execute_order`
2. User cancels order, removing it from `pending_orders`
3. The execution task wakes up and tries to process/delete the already-removed order

### Fix Implementation
The fix involves adding proper synchronization and atomic operations:

```python
import asyncio
from typing import Dict, Optional

class ExecutionManager:
    def __init__(self, config: Config):
        # ... existing initialization
        self._order_lock = asyncio.Lock()  # Add order synchronization

    async def _mock_execute_order(self, order: Order) -> None:
        """Mock order execution for simulation."""
        try:
            # Simulate execution delay
            await asyncio.sleep(self.mock_fill_delay)

            # Atomic check and process under lock
            async with self._order_lock:
                # Double-check order still exists and is pending
                if order.id not in self.pending_orders:
                    self.logger.logger.info(f"Order {order.id} was cancelled before execution")
                    return

                # Proceed with execution logic
                if random.random() < fill_probability:
                    await self._mock_fill_order_locked(order)
                else:
                    if order.type == OrderType.LIMIT:
                        self.logger.logger.info(f"Limit order {order.id} remains pending")
                    else:
                        await self._mock_reject_order_locked(order, "Insufficient liquidity")

        except Exception as e:
            self.logger.log_error(e, {"context": "mock_execution", "order_id": order.id})

    async def _mock_fill_order_locked(self, order: Order) -> None:
        """Mock order fill with proper locking."""
        # Assume we're already under self._order_lock
        try:
            # ... existing fill logic
            
            # Atomic state transition
            if order.id and order.id in self.pending_orders:
                self.completed_orders[order.id] = order
                del self.pending_orders[order.id]
                
                # Update statistics
                self.orders_filled += 1
                self.total_volume += order.quantity * fill_price

        except Exception as e:
            self.logger.log_error(e, {"context": "mock_fill", "order_id": order.id})

    async def cancel_order(self, order_id: str) -> bool:
        """Cancel a pending order with proper synchronization."""
        async with self._order_lock:
            if order_id not in self.pending_orders:
                self.logger.logger.warning(f"Order {order_id} not found for cancellation")
                return False

            order = self.pending_orders[order_id]
            # ... rest of cancellation logic
```

## Bug #3: Hardcoded User-Agent Security Vulnerability

### Location
`trading_bot/market_data/providers/yahoo.py`, line 29

### Bug Description
The Yahoo Finance provider uses a hardcoded User-Agent string that impersonates a specific Chrome browser. This is a security vulnerability and potential legal issue as it:
1. Violates Yahoo's Terms of Service by impersonating a browser
2. Could be detected and blocked by anti-bot measures
3. Represents a form of deceptive practice

### Current Code
```python
headers = {
    "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/91.0.4472.124 Safari/537.36"
}
```

### Impact
- **Severity**: Medium-High
- **Risk**: 
  - Legal liability for Terms of Service violations
  - Service blocking/IP banning
  - Unreliable market data feeds
  - Potential regulatory issues for financial applications

### Root Cause
The code tries to bypass Yahoo Finance's bot detection by spoofing a legitimate browser User-Agent, which is:
- Ethically questionable
- Potentially illegal depending on jurisdiction
- Technically fragile (Yahoo can detect this pattern)

### Fix Implementation
The fix involves using proper API access or implementing transparent User-Agent identification:

```python
# Option 1: Use proper identification
headers = {
    "User-Agent": f"TradingBot/1.0 (+https://yourcompany.com/contact)",
    "Accept": "application/json, text/plain, */*",
    "Accept-Language": "en-US,en;q=0.9"
}

# Option 2: Check if Yahoo provides official API access
# and migrate to legitimate data sources like Alpha Vantage, IEX Cloud, etc.

# Option 3: Add rate limiting and respectful access patterns
class YahooFinanceProvider(BaseProvider):
    def __init__(self, config: MarketDataConfig):
        super().__init__(config)
        self._min_request_interval = 1.0  # Respect rate limits
        self._last_request_time = 0
        
    async def initialize(self) -> None:
        """Initialize with proper, transparent headers."""
        await super().initialize()
        
        # Use transparent, honest identification
        headers = {
            "User-Agent": f"TradingBot/{self.config.version} Python/{platform.python_version()}",
            "Accept": "application/json, */*",
            "Accept-Encoding": "gzip, deflate",
            "Connection": "keep-alive"
        }
        
        self.session = aiohttp.ClientSession(
            timeout=aiohttp.ClientTimeout(total=self.config.timeout),
            headers=headers
        )
        
        # Add disclaimer in logs
        self.logger.logger.warning(
            "Using Yahoo Finance data - ensure compliance with their Terms of Service"
        )
```
